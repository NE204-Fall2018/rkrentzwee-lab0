Based on the low percent error in the validation peak fitting, the nonlinearity is small and a simple linear calibration is suitable for this energy range. For energies below about 100 keV, a higher order polynomial might be needed for more accuracy; the percent error is higher for the 80.9 keV line from Ba-133 than the other validation peaks. Knoll~\cite{knoll2010radiation} suggests fitting using a polynomial of the form 
\begin{equation}
E_i = \sum_{n-0}^N a_n D_i^n .
\end{equation}
A higher order polynomial fitting would need more calibration peaks than the two used in this paper. There is a trade off between the accuracy of a calibration and the time required to run it.
