Energy calibration is a necessary step for every radiation detector. Calibration ensures the accuracy and the quality of the results. Without proper calibration, there is no way to tell how the channel numbers from a multi-channel analyzer correlate to energy. This paper shows a simple linear calibration using Am-241 and Cs-137 and validates the calibration by applying it to Ba-133 and Eu-152.
