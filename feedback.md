# Overall (98/100)
 - Good commit history - appropriate number and size of commits, easily 
   navigable project history

# Build (10/10)
 - Good modifications to README for build instructions

# Testing (10/10)
 - Nice example of a well-designed test

# Intro / Background / Motivation (14/15)
 - Adequate for lab 0; for future labs, make sure to focus on both the what and
   the why in the intro. 

# Methods (15/15)
 - Adequate detail for lab 0: you've managed to capture the crux of the 
   approach in the minimum amount of verbiage - nothing wrong with that!

# Results and discussion (38/40)
 - Descriptive, well-labelled plots displaying relevant information - very good
 - Slight issue with precision implied by significant figures of the 
   calibration model, but if uncertainty is handle explicitly in later analysis
   this can be obviated
 - Tables are excellent (esp. reference to nuclear data) and a great way of
   conveying relevant information in this case

# Conclusion (10/10)
 - Separate conclusion section not required, the discussion section adequately
   addresses the types of considerations expected for such a report.
